# UdemyFrontEnd

I've bought two courses from Udemy in order to learn front end web development: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/ and https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-novice-to-ninja/. I've gathered here some little projects that have been part of these courses. I've not done these all by myself, the process was more like "now pause the video and complete this next step". In JavaScript training project the HTML and CSS was given.

- PersonalPage is HTML and CSS training
- Tindog is Bootstrap training
- InteractiveQuiz and ToDoList are JavaScript training
